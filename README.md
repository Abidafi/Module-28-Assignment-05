## Theoretical Background of Assignment 05. 

## This Project is a Bangladesh Govt. Emergency Response Web-portal.

# 9 serÂ´vice body is under a common platform. They are;
#   a. National Emergency Number
#   b. Police Helpline Number
#   c. Fire Service Number
#   d. Ambulance Service
#   e. Women and Child Helpline.
#   f. Anti-Corruption Helpline.
#   g. Electricity Helpline
#   h. BRAC Helpline
#   i. Bangladesh Railway Helpline

# For this project, HTML, Tailwind CSS and Vanilla Javascript language have been implemented.

# If any curious reader wants to get an idea about the key Javascript functionality those are implemented in this project, they must ask themselves 5 key questions first;

# Question 1: What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
# Question 2: How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?
# Question 3: What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
# Question 4: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
# Question 5: What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

# A summary has been added below keeping in mind the key-points mentioned above:

# JavaScript DOM methods help select elements: 
# getElementById finds single elements by ID. 
# getElementsByClassName selects multiple by class. 
# querySelector/querySelectorAll use CSS selectors for flexible targeting. 
# Creating elements involves document.createElement(), setting properties, and inserting via appendChild(). 
# Event bubbling describes how events propagate upward from child to parent elements. 
# Event delegation uses this behavior by attaching one listener to a parent to handle multiple children efficiently. 
# preventDefault() stops browser default actions like link navigation, while stopPropagation() prevents event bubbling. 
# These concepts are crucial for building interactive web applications like emergency service directories with dynamic content and user interactions.
